# MCMC Anlalysis
Directory housing the code and plots from the MCMC analysis. The `mcmcNMDM.py` script is the master script for running the MCMC for this project. It has command line options to pass observed I-Band values and errors to allow it to be used for different cases. It also has a command line flag to use the standard model machine learning models instead of the neutrino magnetic dipole moment machine learning models for testing purposes only. Each subdirectory has a sample slurm file and the results from a MCMC run with a different observed TRGB I-Band magnitude and uncertainty.
