# Machine Learning Models
Directory housing all of the machine learning models used in this project. It is organized as follows:

* The current directory is a working directory for training the models. Each subdirectory has saved models for different uses.
* The `classifier` directory has a saved version and plots for the classifier used in Neutrino magnetic dipole moment runs of the MCMC
* The `regressor` directory has a saved version and plots for the regressor used in Neutrino magnetic dipole moment runs of the MCMC
* The `SM` directory has models for testing the MCMC with the the standard model
