# Grid Creation
This directory has scripts to generate the grids with MESA input parameters used when running MESA. To generate the first two grids, use the script `genGrid.py`. To generate the third grid, use the script `genGrid3.py`. The grids are then stored in `.txt` files that are directly read by the slurm files in the MESA test_suite directory.
