# Analysis Plotting Code
This directory holds jupyter notebooks and scripts to create informative plots of our results. Most directories are just to create different plots and are not important for the pipeline. On the other hand, the `output_analysis` directory has some important scripts for the post processing pipeline. In that directory, running the `analysis` script after the post processing pipeline in the MESA directory aligns the grids and creates some preliminary plots to check the outputs. It is important to run the `analysis` script before retraining the machine learning models!
