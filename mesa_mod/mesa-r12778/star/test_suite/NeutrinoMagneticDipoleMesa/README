# NeutrinoMagneticDiopoleMoments Mod
Directory housing my MESA mod to include Neutrino
Magnetic Dipole Moments.

To run a job array use the following steps:
1. Navigate to `~/NMDinStars/makeGrids/`
2. Run `python3 genGrids.py --n N` where you should
replace `N` with whatever side length you want on
the grid
3. Navigate to `~/NMDinStars/mesa_mod/mesa-r12276/star/test_suite/NeutrinoMagneticDipoleMoments/`
4. *First* run `./genGrid1`
5. Once you are happy with that, run `./runGrid2` to finish the grid
