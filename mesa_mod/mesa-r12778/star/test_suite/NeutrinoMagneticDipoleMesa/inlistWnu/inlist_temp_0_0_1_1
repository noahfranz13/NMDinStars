      !JS says: this section comes with the test_suite examples. Do not change things unless you know what you are doing.

      use_gold_tolerances = .false. !JS says, generally you should turn these off unless your results are crazy.

      convergence_ignore_equL_residuals = .true. ! needed during flash
      ! note: can get rid of this if turn on conv_vel's.  just takes more steps.

      ! check for retries and backups as part of test_suite
         max_number_backups = -1! 0 !JS says -1 means infinity. It's a good idea to use -1 once you are certain your code runs correctly
         max_number_retries = -1! 90

         retry_limit = -1! 90

      max_model_number = -1 !20000! JS says: this is the maximum model number before the code terminates.

      !xa_central_lower_limit_species(1) = 'he4'!JS says: this is a control for stopping. It sets a lower limit on species  and defines it to be helium-4
      !xa_central_lower_limit(1) = 1d-3 !JS says: this is the abundance of he4 below which the code will terminate

      power_he_burn_upper_limit = 1.0d6 !JS says: this tells MESA to stop when the power in helium burning is greater than 10^6. I set it to 10^6 to stop at the helium flash.

      min_timestep_limit = 1d-8 ! (seconds) !JS says: this tells MESA not to take time-steps smaller than this.

      use_ledoux_criterion = .true. !JS says: this tells MESA to include semiconvection. For this example this won't do much. If you want to see loops for heavier stars turn this on!

      !JS says, the controls below control mass loss on the RGB and AGB. We won't change them today but have a look at star/defaults/control.defaults to see what they do.

      cool_wind_RGB_scheme = 'Reimers'
      cool_wind_AGB_scheme = 'Blocker'
      RGB_to_AGB_wind_switch = 0.75d0
      Reimers_scaling_factor = 0.1d0
      Blocker_scaling_factor = 0.2d0

      !JS says: these control the output of MESA.

      photo_interval = 500000 !JS says: we won't use photos today so I set this to a high number
      profile_interval = 50 !JS says: this tells MESA how often to write profiles
      history_interval = 10 !JS syas: this tells MESA how often to write history files
      terminal_interval = 10 !JS says: this tells MESA how often to write data to the terminal
      write_header_frequency = 10 !JS syas: this tells MESA how often to write a description of the output to the terminal

      !JS says: these control your output files

      write_profiles_flag = .false.! JS says: this turns off profiles. I won't use them today but you may be interested in them in the future.
      log_directory = 'LOGS' !JS says: this is where MESA will output.
      !star_history_header_name = 'TRGB' !If you don't set this then MESA will put the column headings into the data files. This can make it hard for some programs to read so I set this to be a separate file for convenience.
      star_history_name = 'nmdm_0_0_1_1.data' !JS says, this is the name of your output history file.
